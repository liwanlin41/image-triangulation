Floating point errors: matrix inverse, computing intersection point of two segments, double integral area, collinearity determination

Places where error makes a difference and has been coded in: determining boundary of intersection of pixel and triangle (in particular, check to see if an intersection point is a triangle vertex which affects orientation)
