Averages per call

6/23: pixDoubleInt 556ms; pixEnergyInt 550ms; pixLineInt 276ms; Pixel::intersectionArea 1.8ms which is the bulk of integration process

6/24: intersecting all four sides of pixel with a segment takes 600us but intersecting all pixels takes 120ms; just creating the segments for intersection takes only 12us for all pixels though
Significant speed increase: change segment intersection detection to avoid using Matrix class (which required dynamic allocation):
New averages pixDoubleInt 83ms, pixEnergyInt 82ms, pixLineInt 1.1ms; intersectionArea is something like 600us

6/26: added gridded area approximation, for some reason this is super slow? (~3s per call for grid size of 10x10)
ahhhh - Matrix was still used in Triangle::getSignedArea, removing gets double integral down to 800us

6/28: running some more tests: 50 ish triangles on 260x200 image runs in ~1ms per integration call, same number of triangles on 800x464 runs in 4ms per line integral and 7ms per area integral; speed of single integration call is independent of number of triangles, seems to depend on pixel resolution
